# README.md
## The Monkees Website
My project focuses on the popular 1960â€™s rock band, the Monkees. This website is for fans of theirs who like to keep up with their tour dates, listen to their music and easy access to their social media sites. The website also caters to anyone who would like to see where they are touring and possibly book them for any event.

My project home page briefly describes the bands history while also showing pictures of the members of the band.

The second page shows fans the Monkees upcoming tour, when and where they will be performing and links to the venues that they are playing at.

The third page allows for fans to listen to 4 of the bands most popular hits and watch a musicvideo of their hit Daydream Believer. 

The last page allows for anyone to submit a request to book them for events such as wedding, Christmas party or company events.
## UX
The website is for individuals and companies interested in, are fans of and who want to know more about the Monkees. The website provides popular songs, video, photos of the band, direct links to their verified social media sites and a contact page.

This website also allows these individuals to see what dates and where the band is touring, as well as the possibility to send a request to book the band for different events. 

The contact page is more for both individuals and companies who would like to book The Monkees to play. The website offers information about the band, the different bandmembers and some of their most popular hits.
